1. `brew install miredo`

    You must also install tuntap.

    The TunTap project provides kernel extensions for Mac OS X that allow
    creation of virtual network interfaces.

2. `brew install tuntap`

In order for TUN/TAP network devices to work, the tun/tap kernel extensions
must be installed by the root user:

  sudo cp -pR /usr/local/Cellar/tuntap/20111101/Library/Extensions/tap.kext /Library/Extensions/
  sudo cp -pR /usr/local/Cellar/tuntap/20111101/Library/Extensions/tun.kext /Library/Extensions/
  sudo chown -R root:wheel /Library/Extensions/tap.kext
  sudo chown -R root:wheel /Library/Extensions/tun.kext
  sudo touch /Library/Extensions/

To load the extensions at startup, you have to install those scripts too:

  sudo cp -pR /usr/local/Cellar/tuntap/20111101/tap /Library/StartupItems/
  sudo chown -R root:wheel /Library/StartupItems/tap
  sudo cp -pR /usr/local/Cellar/tuntap/20111101/tun /Library/StartupItems/
  sudo chown -R root:wheel /Library/StartupItems/tun

If upgrading from a previous version of tuntap, the old kernel extension
will need to be unloaded before performing the steps listed above. First,
check that no tunnel is being activated, disconnect them all and then unload
the kernel extension:

  sudo kextunload -b foo.tun
  sudo kextunload -b foo.tap
